Key Component Information

- **Cathode:** The positive electrode material is where the primary chemical difference between types lies, determining energy density, stability, and cost.
- **Anode:** The negative electrode in most commercial lithium-ion batteries is made from graphite. LTO chemistry is a notable exception, using lithium titanate as the anode material.
- **Separator:** A porous polymer membrane (typically polyolefin materials like polyethylene or polypropylene) physically separates the anode and cathode to prevent short circuits while allowing lithium ions to flow through the electrolyte. There is only one separator layer, which is a continuous sheet wound in the jelly-roll formation of a cylindrical cell.
- **Electrolyte:** The medium that allows lithium ions to move between the electrodes. It is typically a lithium salt (e.g., LiPF₆) dissolved in an organic solvent.
