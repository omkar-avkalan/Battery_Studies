Reference which i have took , for designing the single cell bms schematic:

And then we have made this ,

*Note : voltage sensor is only working as a voltage divider so to reduce the space , we can shift to voltage divider circuit. (need to calculate the Resistors value for the voltage divider ckt, which will then directly feed to the ADC module. )
