#### **1. Study BMS Implementation by Present EV Companies**

Most major EV manufacturers, such as Tesla, BYD, and those used in models like the BMW i3 and VW e-Golf, employ a decentralized, master-slave system to manage large, high-voltage battery packs efficiently

(a)Understand how EV companies architect their BMS.

#### Overall configuration

- Battery module：Composed of multiple battery cells connected in series
- Voltage detection circuit (for the battery module)：Measures the voltage of the battery module and that of each battery cell
- Monitoring circuit (BMS circuit)：Monitors states of respective battery cells and makes cell balance adjustments
- Temperature detection circuit：Measures the temperature of each cell
- Control circuit：Controls the monitoring operation and cell balance adjustment of the BMS circuit
- Current detection circuit：Measures the overall current flow in the BMS
- Voltage detection circuit (for the BMS)：Measures the overall voltage of the BMS
- Junction box：Cuts off power supply when a problem occurs, to protect the battery
- Voltage detection circuit (for ground fault detection)：Detects a ground fault of the BMS as a whole

(b)Identify the structure of central vs slave units.



## Battery Technologies in the top leading EV companies


#### Porshe taycan:

The Porsche Taycan uses an LG Chem battery module with the following configuration: - The module contains 12 lithium-ion cells arranged in a 6 series 2 parallel (6s2p) configuration, giving it a maximum voltage of 25.2V. - The module monitors the voltage of each cell and records the temperature at two points to ensure safe operation of the battery pack.
