You are at the right stage to formalize protection and fault-detection requirements before jumping to schematics. For this step, focus on clearly defining each protection function, the sensing/actuation paths, and the fault-detection logic for a single cell, but with a view to scaling to multi-cell packs later.[monolithicpower+1](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/learning/resources/understanding-the-role-of-a-battery-management-systems-in-electric-vehicles)​

Below is a compact, step‑1 style technical framing you can directly grow into your requirements document.

---

## 1. Protection functions to define

For each protection, you should specify: thresholds, hysteresis, detection time, what exactly is switched off/limited, and reset conditions.[monolithicpower+1](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/learning/mpscholar/battery-management-systems/bms-functionalities/battery-protection)​

- **Overcharge protection**
    
    - Trigger when cell voltage exceeds a maximum limit (e.g. 4.2–4.25 V for NMC, project-specific).[lithionpower+1](https://lithionpower.com/blog/battery-management-system-for-electric-vehicles-ensuring-efficiency-and-safety/)​
        
    - Action: stop/limit charging via charge FET or contactor, log fault, possibly derate current.
        
    - Include: hardware backup (comparator + fuse or secondary FET) as a last resort.
        
- **Overdischarge protection**
    
    - Trigger when cell voltage drops below minimum limit (e.g. 2.5–2.8 V, chemistry‑dependent).[monolithicpower+1](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/learning/mpscholar/battery-management-systems/bms-functionalities/battery-protection)​
        
    - Action: open discharge path, enter low‑power mode, define conditions to allow recovery charge.
        
- **Overcurrent protection (charge & discharge)**
    
    - Define separate limits for fast transient short protection and sustained overcurrent protection.[cavliwireless+1](https://www.cavliwireless.com/blog/nerdiest-of-things/battery-management-system-in-electric-vehicles)​
        
    - Action: open appropriate FETs/contactors; optionally allow auto‑retry after a cool‑down or time delay.
        
- **Short‑circuit protection**
    
    - Very fast detection using shunt + fast comparator or dedicated protection IC; threshold much higher than normal overcurrent limit.[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12418343/)​
        
    - Action: hard open contactor / blow fuse; may be non‑recoverable in severe cases.
        
- **Overtemperature protection**
    
    - Use NTC or IC sensor; define soft limit (start derating) and hard limit (force shutdown).[monolithicpower+1](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/learning/resources/understanding-the-role-of-a-battery-management-systems-in-electric-vehicles)​
        
    - Consider separate thresholds for charging and discharging, since safe ranges differ.
        
- **Under‑temperature protection**
    
    - Mainly critical for charging (e.g. inhibit charging below 0–5 °C depending on chemistry).[lithionpower+1](https://lithionpower.com/blog/battery-management-system-for-electric-vehicles-ensuring-efficiency-and-safety/)​
        
    - Action: block charge, allow limited discharge; manage pre‑heating if a thermal system exists.
        

At this stage, for each of these, start a requirement line like: “The BMS shall open the charge path within X ms when cell voltage exceeds V_OVP for longer than T_filter.”

## 2. Faulty cell detection mechanisms

These mechanisms sit on top of basic protections and feed into “cell bad / pack derating / service required” logic.[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih+2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12301446/)​

- **Voltage deviation monitoring**
    
    - Compute deviation of each cell from pack average or from model‑predicted voltage (you already have an EKF, which is ideal here).[sciencedirect+1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045790622003500)​
        
    - Persistent high deviation indicates increased internal resistance, loss of capacity, or connection issues; define thresholds over a time window.
        
    - For multi‑cell packs, methods such as PCA or correlation‑based analysis are used in literature to detect inconsistent cells.[chrismi.sdsu+1](https://chrismi.sdsu.edu/publications/207.pdf)​
        
- **Temperature anomaly detection**
    
    - Compare each sensor to neighbouring sensors or expected temperature from a thermal model.
        
    - Use temperature rise rate dT/dtdT/dtdT/dt under similar current to flag internal short or high‑resistance faults.[nature+1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17145-4)​
        
    - Define: normal gradient band, max allowed delta between adjacent cells, and abnormal dT/dtdT/dtdT/dt thresholds.
        
- **Current imbalance / inconsistency analysis**
    
    - For single‑cell stage, current is common, so you focus on consistency between measured current and voltage/SOC response (e.g. EKF residuals).[ieeexplore.ieee+1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6287639/10820123/11017601.pdf)​
        
    - For multi‑cell or parallel groups, logic compares branch currents; sustained imbalance indicates a faulty cell or connection.
        

For the document, you can structure each mechanism as: “Monitored signals → algorithm (threshold, model‑based, or ML) → fault classification → action (derate, isolate, log, service request).”

## 3. Single‑cell vs multi‑cell focus (for later)

Even though you are now on single‑cell, design with scale‑up in mind.[synopsys+1](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-a-battery-management-system.html)​

- **Single‑cell implementation focus**
    
    - Validate: sensing accuracy (V, I, T), basic protections, EKF‑based SOC, and simple fault flags on one cell.
        
    - Implement protections first in software with hardware limits as backup (comparators, fuses, dedicated protection IC).
        
- **Multi‑cell pack considerations (to capture later)**
    
    - Cell balancing strategies, isolation and high‑voltage safety, communication (daisy‑chain or CAN), and compliance with ISO 26262 safety goals.[evengineeringonline+2](https://www.evengineeringonline.com/how-does-iso-26262-road-vehicles-functional-safety-standards-apply-to-evs/)​
        
    - More advanced fault diagnosis (voltage correlation methods, PCA/KPCA, ML‑based classifiers) already exist in EV industry and can be referenced.[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih+3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12301446/)​

## 4. Suggested next concrete step

For the _next_ iteration, a useful step is:

- Create a small table (for your internal doc) for each protection:
    
    - Inputs (sensors, signals)
        
    - Thresholds & timing
        
    - Fault code and severity
        
    - Actuation path (which FET/contactor, whether hardware backup exists)
        
    - Reset strategy (auto/manual/latched)
        

If you share your target cell chemistry and nominal pack specs, the next step can be to draft actual numerical limits and a block‑diagram‑level architecture that you can later convert into schematics.
