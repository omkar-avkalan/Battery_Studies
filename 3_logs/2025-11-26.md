### What are the most important tasks I need to accomplish today to move my project forward?
- [x] **Practical Check of Internal Resistance**  
Perform IR measurement on AA, AAA, Li-ion, and NiMH cells and compare with nominal values.
- [x] **Study Voltage, Capacity, C-Rating & kW Meaning**  
Document battery ratings, run sample calculations, and relate to real usage scenarios.
- [ ] - **Charging Circuit Basics — Notes**  
    Write notes on CC–CV charging, BMS role, overcurrent/overcharge protection, and device charging behavior.
- [x] **Internal Inspection — Lithium-Ion Battery**  
Open and examine Li-ion cell (safe/dead pack), document thermal properties, jelly-roll structure, separator, anode/cathode layers, and analyze safety considerations.

### What progress did I make today, and how does it align with my project goals?
